  In theory you can have as many array dimensions as you want.  For example a 3D array of ising spins could be represented as:
  \begin{lstlisting}
  bool isingSpins[nX][nY][nZ];
  \end{lstlisting}
  In practice you have to worry about how much memory your array needs!\pause{}  If you want to find out use:
  \begin{lstlisting}
  std::cout << "Need: " << sizeof(bool) * nX * nY * nZ <<
    " bytes";
  \end{lstlisting}
